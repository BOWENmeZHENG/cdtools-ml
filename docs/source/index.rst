Introduction to CDTools
=======================

CDTools is a python library for autodifferentiation-based coherent diffractive imaging reconstructions. The core of the library is a set of simple tools built in pytorch for basic operations relevant to coherent diffraction - math operations on complex numbers, subpixel shifts, propagators, and the like. In addition, a set of database types exist to help with easily loading and saving data to/from .cxi files. Finally, a collection of ptychography models are implemented which allow for a variety of different styles of ptychographic reconstructions.
